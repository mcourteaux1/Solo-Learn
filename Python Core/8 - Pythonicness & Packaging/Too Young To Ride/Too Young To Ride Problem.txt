
The carousel is designed for 3 people who are each at least 16 years old.
You are given a program that takes all 3 passengers' ages as inputs and inserts them in a list. Complete the program so that if it finds a value less than 16, it breaks the loop and outputs "Too young!".
If the age requirement is satisfied, the program outputs "Get ready!".
