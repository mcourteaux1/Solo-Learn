A coffee vending machine makes 5 types of coffee:
coffee = ["Café Latte", "Caffe Americano", "Espresso", "Cappuccino", "Macchiato"] 

Each coffee option has its own number, starting with 0. Write a program that will take a number from the customer as input from the customer and serve the corresponding 
coffee type. If the customer enters a number that is out of the accepted range, the program should output "Invalid number". Regardless of coffee option result, 
the program should output "Have a good day" at the end.
