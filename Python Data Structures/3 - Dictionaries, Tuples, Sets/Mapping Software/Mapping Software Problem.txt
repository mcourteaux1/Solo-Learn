You are working on a mapping software. The map is stored as a list of points, where each item is represented as a tuple, containing the X and Y coordinates of the point.
You need to calculate and output the distance to the closest point from the point (0, 0).
To calculate the distance of the point (x, y) from (0, 0), use the following formula: √x²+y²
